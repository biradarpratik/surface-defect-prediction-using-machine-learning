This project introduces an innovative approach to detecting and categorizing defects on steel surfaces, which is crucial for maintaining product quality and safety standards across various industries. The proposed method combines two traditional machine learning techniques, the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP), to accurately identify and classify six common types of defects: patches, inclusions, crazing, pitted surfaces, rolled-in scale, and scratches. GLCM is leveraged to capture essential textural and spatial information, providing a robust foundation for defect detection and classification, while LBP enhances the feature analysis process, improving precision and recall rates, even for intricate and subtle defects. This innovative approach aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of defect detection in the steel industry, ensuring products meet the highest quality and safety standards.
